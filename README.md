# Negative-Tweet-Detector

In this project the area of focus is the analysis of negative online behaviour. Online 
communication has contributed considerably well to the quality of human life but it 
also includes enormous threats as online communication with high obscenity, 
toxicity and profanity cause individual assaults, online provocation and harassing 
practices. Such issues happen almost all the time, across all platforms of discussion, 
and the modulators of these platforms have limited capabilities dealing with it. 
Therefore, it becomes the responsibility of the hosting organizations to ensure that 
the environment is profane-free. 
Negative comment detection and classification has become an active research field 
with many recently proposed approaches. However, while these approaches address 
some of the task's challenges others still remain unsolved and directions for further 
research are needed.
The study is aimed to build optimised model for the same by comparing the 
performance of different approaches on the dataset taken from kaggle.com. In the 
first approach, we cleaned the text data by eliminating stop-words and 
lemmatization. Tfidf vectorizer is used for encoding and feature extraction. Then we 
trained our model using two standard machine learning algorithms (Logistic 
Regression and Na√Øve Bayes). The computed result is analyzed and the accuracy is 
compared. The better performing model had been used by a webapp designed by us 
that takes any statement as an input and gives the percentage of various negativity 
measures in it as an output. The model is created for the English and Hinglish 
languages
We use this model in web page as well as in App
